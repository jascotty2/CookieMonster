CookieMonster! - iConomy Money and Items for PvM

Description:
This is a continuation of Coelho's initial CookieMonster
CookieMonster is based off of the inactive iMonster, however uses none of the code from it, 
so it is extremely lightweight and fast. 


Features:
configurable item drops and economy reward for each monster
configurable economy reward for items used to kill monsters
Supports iConomy & BOSeconomy
Ability to change entity drops with drop-rate.
Ability to add minimum and maximum money drops for randomness


doesn't allow to damage a creature/mobspawner if penalty is greater than account balance
option to only drop items for a direct kill (stops autofarmers)
option to replace normal drops with custom drops
option to drop custom drops items globally
configurable messages (including if there is no reward)
can distingush charged from normal creepers, and tame/pet wolves from wild wolves
can disable/enable rewards for defined regions


Commands:
/cookiemonster (cm) reload		reloads settings from configuration file
/cm region define <id>			set a region (once a region is selected in worldedit)
/cm region list [page]			list regions (in current world if as a player)
/cm region remove <id>			to remove regions


To-Do:
mob farming checks (track kill locations & time)
? import itemsDB from bettershop to check against config (check if valid items entered as drops)
permissions? (for rewards & maybe permission to kill without penalty?)
penalties/rewards for killing players (even groups)


Changelog:

Version 1.5 - 7/20/11
added a kill tracking system to check for spawn camping
- define a square-radius for area to check, including max. elevation change
- define # of kills in this area within a timespan
- anything over that number within the area will disable rewards until the records are old enough to be removed
- so far, only lasts in server memory, so records are lost on server stop/reload
fixed anonymous replace/add drops setting
(hopefully) fixed a nullpointer exception in region checking


Version 1.4 - 7/14/11
wolves updated for mc 1.6 (although appearent breaks didn't really seem to be broken, anyway...)
- notibly, entities killed with wolves will reward the owner
fixed decimal reward if using older iConomy
added option to not clear drops before adding custom drops
added ability to disable for defined worlds
added regions (selections using worldguard, most code came from worldguard)
- command to set (once a region is selected in worldedit) -  /cm region define <id>
- can list regions (in current world if as a player) -  /cm region list [page]
- then, to remove regions -  /cm region remove <id>
- default is to disable for these regions
- - on disabled worlds, regions will be enabled areas
- alternatively, can be set to only be enabled in defined regions
"Wolf" has been replaced with "Wild_Wolf"
- and added "Tame_Wolf" & "Pet_Wolf"
added "Charged_Creeper"
